This experimental project stems from the conjecture that the prolonged exposure to static noise (e.g. TV static) is useful at reducing the symptoms of the [visual snow condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow).

This shared belief is put forward by several people on online forums, for example at https://mvertigo.org/t/how-i-cured-my-palinopsia/15781.
